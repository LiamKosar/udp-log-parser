Make the logs independent of actions - keep it so i can 'parse' the log based on the schema, but I don't need to force people to use postgres. 
instead, we can make an interface with a 'commit' method that pairs alongside the schema for 'any' outcome

Also thinking i just completely separate parsing from pushing. Maybe we parse the tuples out of the logs then push those tuples
into a designated redis queue for redundancy + any sort of downstream consumer. A redis q is also more observable, we track things like queue size
and stuff. We can also add backups. There's also no risk of overloading the memory on the machine the local udp log parser is running on.
